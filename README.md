# Erik's Advent Of Code repository
>Hello to whoever is reading this for some reason!

This is my (Erik's) set of solution scripts to the [2019 advent of code challenge!](https://adventofcode.com/)

These are all done by myself in python, mostly just for fun and for practice/bragging rights among my coworkers.

If you have any comments/questions about how or why I've done something feel free to let me know. I've tried to make these quite readable but that wasn't my main worry. 

Also, I've tried to do these so that the solutions are quite fast, and while I don't know for sure that each of these solutions is computationally optimal(they probably aren't), I've made efforts to balance speed of compute, speed to solve, and scope/readibility of code.

Also also, I'm trying to avoid using external libraries where I can, even though they would make solutions much simpler (e.g NetworkX would make Day 6 much cleaner). I feel like doing it this way helps me to understand the algorithms and solutions better.

Thanks! Enjoy reading this for whatever reason you're reading it!

Erik
