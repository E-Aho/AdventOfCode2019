# Erik's Advent Of Code repository
>Hello to whoever is reading this for some reason!

This is my(Erik) set of solution scripts to the [2019 advent of code challenge!](https://adventofcode.com/)

These are all done by myself in python, mostly just for fun and for practice/bragging rights among my coworkers.
